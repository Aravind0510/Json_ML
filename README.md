# Disease Medication and Insurance Prediction
This project involves the development of a predictive model for disease medication and insurance standard using synthetic JSON data. The application is built with Flask for deployment and leverages machine learning to provide predictions based on user input.

Features
Disease Medication Prediction: Predicts medication recommendations based on disease conditions, allergies, and chronic conditions.
Insurance Standard Prediction: Predicts appropriate insurance plans based on age, disease condition, and type of disease.
Flask Deployment: Deployed via Flask to provide a web interface for interacting with the predictive models.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for model development and backend logic.
Flask: Web framework used for deploying the application.
Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch: Libraries for machine learning model development.
JSON: Data format used for synthetic data and model input/output.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

Usage
Disease Medication Prediction:

Provide relevant input data (e.g., disease condition, allergies) through the web interface.
The model will output recommended medication.
Insurance Standard Prediction:

Enter data such as age, disease condition, and type of disease.
The model will suggest appropriate insurance plans.
